# Mallard_Mutation

The data directory contains:
- the raw transition rates in  Final_merged_data_MA_Lines
- the A6140 G matrix released in the Mallard Stasis manuscript
- a table with the sample size per assay block

The Rcode directory contains all code to reproduce the analysis.

We also included txt output files showing the different computed G/M matrices (txt directory) and the auto-correlation plots from the MCMCglmm models.
RData files produced by the code are too large and will be stored on Dryad upon publication.
